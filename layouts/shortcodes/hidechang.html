<p>We show that Chang's chaining argument is logically invalid. We do so by proposing two formal reconstructions of it. In the first, we assume that the set of elements to be ranked has no structure. In this setting, whether the trichotomy thesis is true is independent of the chaining argument. In the second reconstruction, we put the most minimal conditions on the set that allow us to state the chaining argument in a way that bears its conceptual meaning. In this setting, the argument is false, since its assumptions are inconsistent with each other. Our results demonstrate that the existence of `non-conventional' value relations cannot be established by endorsing or rejecting the chaining argument. The chaining argument does not provide insights into axiology.</p>
