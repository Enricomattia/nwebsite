<p>We develop and test a theory of how beliefs about people's responsiveness to incentives shape preferences for redistribution. Participants in a simple economy exhibit partial altruism towards the worse-off in the society. They vote on the tax rate and then work. The higher their altruism level, the more attenuated their labour supply response will be to an increase in the tax rate, as part of production goes to the worse-off. If an agent believes that others will react significantly to the lower incentives of more redistributive systems, she will favour less egalitarian policies. Due to pessimistic beliefs about other agents' altruism, a poor and/or relatively altruistic agent can vote for a lower tax rate than a rich and/or more selfish individual. On aggregate, if beliefs are overly pessimistic, there will be too little redistribution compared to what would emerge under complete information about preferences. We test the theory in a laboratory experiment.</p>
