<p>hy do people hold conflicting views on redistributive policies? We develop a simple theory of how beliefs on people's reactions to incentives under different redistributive institutions shape these views. If an agent believes that participants in the economy will react significantly to the lower incentives of more redistributive systems, she will favour less egalitarian policies. Due to her pessimistic beliefs about other agents' altruism, a poor and/or relatively altruistic agent can choose a more capitalist system than a rich and/or more selfish individual. On aggregate, if beliefs are overly pessimistic, there will be too low redistribution compared to what would emerge under complete information about preferences. We provide experimental evidence for our theory.</p>
