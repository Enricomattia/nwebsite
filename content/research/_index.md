__A Foundation for Universalisation in Games__
_Abstract_: According to revealed preference theory, the choice of a decision maker "reveals" his tastes over possible outcomes. However, if an act is prescribed by a moral principle for reasons unrelated to the consequences it induces, the inference drawn regarding preferences is misleading. In this paper, I study the behaviour of deontological decision makers who follow the moral principle of universalisation. I develop a decision theory according to which agents value the impact of their choice in determining a counterfactual outcome they envision. Hence, an action can be interpreted as revealing a preference for counterfactual outcomes. I show that I can specify my framework to obtain the most prominent models of universalisation, compare them and highlight their limitations. I propose a unifying model of universalisation based on my decision theoretic framework that arguably overcomes these limitations.

When I was younger (and much fooler) I wrote a couple of pieces for various reasons. Although these are poorly written and hardly rigorous, I find that the ideas were nice and I might polish and rewrite them in the future.
