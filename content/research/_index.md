##### Work in Progress

##### Young and Fool
---

When I was younger (and much fooler) I wrote a couple of pieces for various reasons. Although these are poorly written and hardly rigorous, I find that the ideas were nice and I might polish and rewrite them in the future.

__Magic the Gathering: economic analysis of the market of a collectible card game__

__Praxeology, Psychohistory, Economics__
