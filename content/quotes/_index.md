While reading, I sometimes catch some nice quotes on random topics. I collect them here, in no particular order, with or without commentary. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any of them!

> For instance, there is no need to argue whether economics (or decision theory, or sociology) is a science. We may define “science” in a way that includes economics or in a way that doesn’t, depending on which generalizations will be easier to state using the definition.

 Gilboa, I. (2009). Theory of decision under uncertainty (Vol. 45). Cambridge university press. (p. 58)

I asked myself and discussed with others about this point multiple times. But in the end, I stopped caring. I think sometimes the word "this is science" is used in a loaded way, meaning something like "oh but this is truly correct, not an opinion." Is it about the accuracy of predictions? Then just set the bar you like for accepting a discipline as a science. Is it about math? Economists use math, and their results are no different than those in mathematics or other "sciences."
