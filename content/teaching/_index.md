Welcome to the class website! Here I will post the material I produce for the course, namely solutions to exercises and maybe some extras that could be useful. Contact me if you have any questions!

### Lectures

There could be mistakes, use the official solutions as a reference! Feel free to point out any typos, mistakes, or answers that are not clear. If you want you can check the [plan](../TDs/Plan_20232024.html) for the lectures. Solutions will come out lecture by lecture. If you obtained solutions from other sources, don't consult them! You will do way better on the exam if you attempt to do the exercises yourself before the lecture.


Coming soon...

### Extras

If you click on the link below, you will find a code that solves and plots the Solow-Swan model! I tried to make it as straightforward as possible by including instructions. Just click on the link and see if you can play around with the code. Good luck!

<!-- Here you can find the solutions to the 2020 and 2019 midterms. However, I strongly suggest you focus on the class and TD material before attempting it!

<!-- Here you can find the courses I teach/taught with the material.

__Topics in Macro I__ (Fall 2022) - TSE Third year of Bachelor - see the material [here](../fall2022/) and the syllabus [here](https://www.tse-fr.eu/sites/default/files/TSE/ecole/doc/syllabi/2020-2021/l3_s1_topics_in_macro_1_cm_lepage-saucier.pdf). [Here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Enricomattia/TopicsInMacro1TD/HEAD?filepath=solow-swan.ipynb) you can find a Jupyter Notebook (with instructions) that solves a simple version of the Solow-Swan model.

__Topics in Macro I__ (Fall 2021) - TSE Third year of Bachelor - see the material [here](../fall2021/) - updated material in 2022!

_**ANNOUNCEMENT**_ : In the last TD Lecture I will do [this](../TDs/Solaria.html) exercise on the Malthus model. I will post the solutions here after the lectures. I uploaded solutions for the overlapping generation part of the class that you were unable to do. I will also post soon solutions for the exercise on Easter Island with a tipping point. Lastly, I added some extra below.

_**ANNOUNCEMENT**_ : In the seventh TD session (the week of the 7th of November) I will spend the first part of the lecture answering your questions about the material for the midterm. After you complete asking questions, I will start covering the material of the TD in the plan below. I will answer questions for a maximum of 45 minutes. Hence at least half of the lecture will be devoted to the TD material. As usual, I am available to organise meetings outside the lecture to answer your questions. Good luck! -->
