Welcome to the class website! Here I will post the material I produce for the course, namely solutions to exercises and maybe some extras that could be useful. Contact me if you have any question!


_**ANNOUNCEMENT**_ : In the seventh TD session (the week of the 7th of November) I will spend the first part of the lecture answering your questions about the material for the midterm. After you complete asking questions, I will start covering the material of the TD in the plan below. I will answer questions for a maximum of 45 minutes. Hence at least half of the lecture will be devoted to the TD material. As usual, I am available to organise meetings outside the lecture to answer your questions. Good luck!

### Extras

If you click on the link below, you can find some codes that solve and plot the Solow-Swan model! I tried to make it as straightforward as possible by including instructions. Just click on the link and see if you are able to play around with the code. Good luck!

<!-- Here you can find the solutions to the 2020 and 2019 midterm. However, I strongly suggest you to focus on the class and TD material before attempting it! -->
